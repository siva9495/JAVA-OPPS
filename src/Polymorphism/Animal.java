    //method overloading -- when we define multiple same method name in one class with the different parameters is called method overloading

    // method overloading -- I have the multiple methods in the class with same method name and same return type but different parameters is called mo.

    //method overriding -- allow us to redefined the parent class methods to the child class, based on the requirements is called method overriding.
